# FizzBuzz

## Personal Project

Fizz Buzz is a children's word game that teaches division. It's also a classic technical interview question at countless companies.

Here is how the game works: We count from 1 to a given number ("1, 2, 3, ..."):

- If the next number is a multiple of 3, we say "Fizz".
- If the next number is a multiple of 5, we say "Buzz".
- If the next number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, we say "FizzBuzz"!
